# Standards of Practice for Occupational Therapy
**Source:** American Occupational Therapy Association. (2021). American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 75(Suppl. 3).

## Introduction
This document defines minimum standards for the practice of occupational therapy. Occupational therapy practice addresses the physical, cognitive, psychosocial, sensory–perceptual, and other aspects of clients’ performance in a variety of contexts to support their engagement in occupations that affect physical and mental health, well-being, and quality of life. The Standards of Practice for Occupational Therapy are requirements for occupational therapists and occupational therapy assistants for the delivery of occupational therapy services.

## Definitions
The following definitions are used in this document:
* **Activities:** Actions designed and selected to support the development of performance skills and performance patterns to enhance occupational engagement.
* **Assessment:** A specific tool, instrument, or systematic interaction used to understand a client’s occupational profile, client factors, performance skills, performance patterns, and contextual and environmental factors, as well as activity demands that influence occupational performance.
* **Client:** Person (including one involved in the care of a client), group (collection of individuals having shared characteristics or common or shared purpose, e.g., family members, workers, students, and those with similar interests or occupational challenges), or population (aggregate of people with common attributes such as contexts, characteristics, or concerns, including health risks).
* **Discontinuation of services:** Occurs when the client ends services after meeting short- and long-term goals or chooses to no longer receive services.
* **Evaluation:** The comprehensive process of obtaining and interpreting the data necessary to understand the person, system, or situation. Evaluation requires synthesis of all data obtained, analytic interpretation of that data, reflective clinical reasoning, and consideration of occupational performance and contextual factors.
* **Intervention:** Process and skilled actions taken by occupational therapy practitioners in collaboration with the client to facilitate engagement in occupation related to health and participation. The intervention process includes the plan, implementation, and review.
* **Occupation:** Everyday personalized activities that people do as individuals, in families, and with communities to occupy time and bring meaning and purpose to life. Occupations can involve the execution of multiple activities for completion and can result in various outcomes.
* **Outcome:** Result clients can achieve through occupational therapy intervention.
* **Reevaluation:** Reappraisal of the client’s performance and goals to determine the type and amount of change that has taken place.
* **Screening:** Process of reviewing available data, observing a client, or administering screening instruments to identify a person’s (or a population’s) potential strengths and limitations and the need for further assessment.
* **Transition:** Movement from one life role or experience to another. In occupational therapy, transitions are actions coordinated to prepare for or facilitate a change, such as from one functional level to another, from one life stage to another, from one program to another, or from one environment to another.
