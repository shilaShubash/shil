## Introduction: The Role of Strategies
Promoting effective strategy use is an integral part of enabling occupational performance; however, there are variations in how strategies are defined, discussed, used, and applied in occupational therapy practice. One of our important roles as occupational therapists is to know how to support optimal strategy use among our clients to enable their occupational performance.

The frameworks are designed to reduce ambiguity, deepen understanding, and serve as clinical reasoning guides assisting therapists in specifying, describing, and observing cognitive strategies during occupational performance.

## Defining the Core Concepts
**What Are Strategies?**
Strategies are basically tools or plans of action used for accomplishing a task or achieving a purpose; they are always goal directed. Strategies have also been described as tactics, procedures, or methods a person may use either consciously or automatically to acquire new skills or cope with a challenging activity or problem. Thus, strategy use includes the application of "how to" knowledge.

**What Is a Cognitive Strategy?**
A cognitive strategy is a mental plan of action that allows a person to approach a new task systematically. Strategies, in effect, are mind tools for learning and adaptation because they help a person to adapt to external demands and support occupational acquisition or performance. We propose, as a working definition, that a cognitive strategy is a mental plan of action that helps a person to learn, problem solve, and perform and that the use of cognitive strategies can improve an individual's learning, problem solving, and task performance in terms of efficiency, speed, accuracy, and consistency.

## Taxonomy: Types of Cognitive Strategies
*We utilize a descriptive typography, using three main types:*

1.  **Modality-specific Strategies:** Visual, tactile, auditory, or kinesthetic cues. For example, use of pictures, signs, tones, vibrating beeper, light touch, deep pressure, movement to attract attention, provide guidance in task steps, or prompt memory or actions.
2.  **Mental or Self-verbalization Strategies:** Techniques that involve mental operations, inner speech or imagery, or thinking and talking aloud.
    * *Rehearsal:* Repeating information mentally or verbally such as key words, rules, procedures, action steps...
    * *Mnemonic technique:* Forming associations between words, sets of words, pictures, or images to cue actions or recall.
    * *Rote scripts:* Repeating information that has been coded or abbreviated to guide a sequence of actions.
    * *Association:* Linking similar information together based on previous experiences.
    * *Elaboration:* Expands or adds to new information and relates it to previous information.
    * *Imagery:* Mental images involve transforming physical objects, events, actions, or experiences into images, symbols, or representations.
    * *Reconstruction:* Thinking back involves replaying, imagining, or verbalizing a previous activity.
    * *Anticipation:* Imagining or verbalizing potential challenges or obstacles... to assist in preparing for a task.
    * *Translation:* Translation of information such as written instructions... into images, phrases, or more manageable chunks.
    * *Self-guidance:* Provide oneself instructions, self-cues, or reminders.
    * *Self-coaching:* Positive self-talk, thinking, and encouragement to increase persistence or to help regulate emotions.
    * *Self-questioning:* Imagining or asking oneself key questions related to the task.
    * *Knowledge:* Identifying, verbalizing, or thinking about what one knows about a task before beginning.
3.  **Task Specification/Modification:** Strategies that involve specifying, changing, or adjusting the task stimuli or arrangement.
    * *Stimuli reduction:* Decreasing the amount of information or number of items presented at any one time.
    * *Organization:* Reorganizing task materials or steps so that similar items or steps are together.
    * *Task simplification:* Breaking apart steps or reducing steps... into more manageable parts.
    * *Lists:* Creating or using a written, pictorial, or audiotaped list of steps.
    * *Pacing strategies:* Actions that assist with the timing of activities (e.g., taking breaks... humming a tone).
    * *Task specification:* Identify specific relevant features or components of a task prior to an activity.
    * *Attention to doing:* Identifying key cues or features to pay attention to during performance.
    * *Finger pointing:* Pointing to relevant task stimuli to enhance attention to details.

## Framework 1: Cognitive Strategy Attributes
*This framework is designed to guide clinicians' reasoning in selecting a strategy.*

**The 7 Attributes:**
1.  **Strategy Outcome:** Acquisition/reacquisition of skills, enhanced ability to cope, or optimal performance.
2.  **Strategy Purpose:**
    * *Performance strategies:* Support accuracy, quality, or proficiency during an activity.
    * *Learning strategies:* Optimize attention, comprehension, retention, and integration of information.
    * *Self-regulation strategies:* Help a person monitor emotions/arousal, detect errors, and evaluate performance.
3.  **Range of Application:** Specific (restricted to specific activities/contexts) vs. General (widely used across situations).
4.  **Visibility:** Overt (observable/visible) vs. Covert (internalized/mental processes).
5.  **Permanence:** Temporary (used in initial phases then faded) vs. Permanent (always used to support performance).
6.  **Performance Phase:** Before, During, or After the activity.
7.  **Strategy Target:** Directed at the *Person* (internal abilities) or the *Task/Environment* (modifying external demands).

**Clinical Reasoning Questions (The "Mentor's Checklist"):**
* Will the strategy be used in specific tasks or contexts or will the strategy be used across a wide variety of situations?
* Will the strategy be observable (overt) and then gradually faded or internalized (covert), or will it remain overt?
* Will the strategy be faded as treatment progresses, or is it expected to be used permanently?
* Will the strategy be used before, during, after, or throughout an activity?
* Is the strategy best directed towards the task or environment or towards the person?

### Clinical Application Examples (Table 3)
* **Example 1:**
    * *Problem:* During jumping rope, child jumps in wrong spot and often misses.
    * *Strategy:* Visual cue - Child looks for tape on the floor when jumping rope.
    * *Attributes:* Performance purpose, Specific range, Overt, Temporary, During activity, Task target.
* **Example 2:**
    * *Problem:* Client misses items on the left side.
    * *Strategy:* Visual cue - Client places a brightly colored object on the left side before beginning activities.
    * *Attributes:* Skill reacquisition outcome, General range, Overt then covert, Temporary/Permanent, Before/During, Environment target.
* **Example 3:**
    * *Problem:* Child does not initiate or follow morning routine.
    * *Strategy:* List - Child refers to a written list of steps... places star on wall chart when completed.
    * *Attributes:* Skill acquisition outcome, Specific range, Overt, Temporary, During, Task target.
* **Example 4:**
    * *Problem:* Client's performance is disorganized and haphazard.
    * *Strategy:* List - Client taught to make a list of steps prior to *every* activity.
    * *Attributes:* Cope with challenge outcome, General range, Overt, Permanent, Before, Person & Task target.
* **Example 5:**
    * *Problem:* Client becomes easily sidetracked, leaves out steps.
    * *Strategy:* Mental Rehearsal - Prior to multiple step activities, client mentally imagines doing each step.
    * *Attributes:* Optimize performance, General range, Covert, Temporary/Permanent, Before, Person & Task target.
* **Example 6:**
    * *Problem:* Client easily becomes frustrated with challenging tasks.
    * *Strategy:* Mental Rehearsal - Client mentally imagines a calm ocean whenever he or she begins to feel angry.
    * *Attributes:* Enhance self-regulation, General range, Covert, Temporary/Permanent, During, Person target.
* **Example 7:**
    * *Problem:* Client only recalls last step of 2- or 3-step directions.
    * *Strategy:* Verbal Rehearsal - Client repeats and rehearses each step of instructions silently to self.
    * *Attributes:* Optimize learning, General range, Covert, During, Person target.

## Framework 2: Cognitive Strategy Use (Analysis Tool)
*This framework defines the prerequisites and execution components the Mentor must assess.*

**A. Prerequisites to Effective Strategy Use**
1.  **Strategy knowledge:** Does client know what a strategy is, how it operates, and when/why it should be applied?
2.  **Strategy repertoire:** Is the client's range or repertoire of strategies adequate?
3.  **Strategy beliefs:** What are the client's beliefs (e.g., "strategies will not help")?
4.  **Anticipation and recognition of need:** Does the client anticipate challenges? Do they identify the need to use a strategy?
5.  **Strategy generation and selection:** Does the client self-generate strategies or are they provided by others?

**B. Strategy Execution**
1.  **Initiation:** Is strategy spontaneously initiated by the client?
2.  **Implementation:** Are strategies carried out completely and accurately?
3.  **Number of strategies:** Can the client use/coordinate multiple strategies simultaneously?

**C. Quality of Strategy Use**
1.  **Degree of effort:** Does degree of effort negatively affect performance or speed?
2.  **Temporal pattern:** Are strategies used too late, overused, or fading too soon?
3.  **Flexibility of strategy use:** Does client adjust or switch strategies when needed?
4.  **Monitoring and evaluating:** Does client know when strategies have not been efficient? Are errors recognized?

**D. Effectiveness of Strategy Use**
* Are positive changes in learning, problem solving, or performance outcomes observed?

## Key Messages for the Mentor
* Strategies are not just compensatory. They support skill acquisition or reacquisition and help individuals regulate and manage challenges.
* Enabling occupational performance requires skilled use of strategies requiring careful consideration of the attributes as well as analysis and observation of effective strategy use.
* It is not enough to demonstrate or instruct a person in strategy use; interventions must incorporate methods to help a person discover, understand, anticipate, or recognize the need for the strategy.
