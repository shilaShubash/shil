## Definition and Types of Professional Reasoning
**Definition:** Professional reasoning is a processing process used by occupational therapists for the purpose of understanding, analyzing, planning, and implementing intervention. This process is accompanied by constant questioning at every stage of professional practice, leading to systematic and in-depth work, and allowing the clarification of professional considerations in choosing the intervention to occupational therapists, clients, and colleagues.

Occupational therapists use a professional reasoning process to select assessment tools, define goals, intervention approaches, and therapeutic means and activities. Professional reasoning enables occupational therapists to identify the person's needs, the relevant person factors, as well as the meaning of occupations for them (OTPF, 2014; 2016).

### Types of Professional Reasoning:
1.  **Scientific Reasoning:** Decision-making based on theoretical and scientific knowledge and research evidence (Evidence-based practice). This reasoning can include **Diagnostic reasoning**, which focuses on analyzing clinical characteristics, and **Procedural reasoning**, which refers to situations where occupational therapists examine the appropriate path and means.
2.  **Narrative Reasoning:** Based on the personal experiential story of the person and their environment, while referring to the past, the present, and the future expected for them.
3.  **Pragmatic Reasoning:** Allows for adapting or changing the treatment/intervention process in accordance with various factors such as financial resources, physical environment, availability of treatment equipment, professional skills, and the therapist's personal state.
4.  **Ethical Reasoning:** Allows occupational therapists to analyze ethical dilemmas that arise during intervention and choose different ways to cope with them.
5.  **Interactive Reasoning:** Directed at building interpersonal relationships and enables joint work for identifying problems and solving them.
6.  **Conditional Reasoning:** Integrates all types of clinical reasoning in order to allow occupational therapists to respond flexibly to changing situations while referring to the possibilities expected for the person.

## Implementation of Professional Reasoning in the Intervention Process (Table)

### Stage: Data Collection and Building an Occupational Profile
* **Scientific Reasoning:** Asking questions regarding subjects related to the diagnosis and treatments given in the past. Collecting information from the personal file, medical file, performing observations in different functional environments. Administering standardized assessments.
* **Narrative Reasoning:** Clarifying attitudes and perceptions of the student, their family, and significant factors in the community regarding the difficulty (illness, functional limitation). Conducting interviews with the student and their family. Clarifying attitudes toward change and treatment.
* **Pragmatic Reasoning:** Adapting assessment tools to resources in the setting.
* **Ethical Reasoning:** Exercising discretion in a respectful assessment process based on professional ethical values. Avoiding causing harm.
* **Interactive Reasoning:** Conducting an interview, conversation, and personal meeting with the student and their family.

### Stage: Intervention Planning
* **Scientific Reasoning:** Choosing an intervention model (direct/monitoring/consultation), type of intervention (individual, group, the class as a group), and treatment approach. Selection of treatment environment.
* **Narrative Reasoning:** Adapting the model to the patient's narrative. Selection of a treatment environment that befits the student's needs, diagnosis, and treatment goals.
* **Pragmatic Reasoning:** Intervention model is based on resources. Selection of treatment environment according to availability and accessibility of rooms. Defining reporting methods according to the educational institution's procedures.
* **Ethical Reasoning:** Choice of model is based on the occupational therapist's knowledge and training, and its implementation meets ethical criteria. Selection of an environment that respects treatment delivery.
* **Interactive Reasoning:** Sharing with the multi-disciplinary team in choosing the model and type of treatment. Coordinating the treatment environment with staff members by mutual agreement. Choosing ways to report to the team in alignment with the educational institution's procedures.

### Stage: Documentation and Reporting
* **Scientific Reasoning:** Regular documentation of the treatment course.
* **Narrative Reasoning:** Choosing ways to report. Sharing the student and parents in the process.
* **Pragmatic Reasoning:** Choosing ways to report.
* **Ethical Reasoning:** Documentation and reporting while maintaining ethical criteria of privacy/confidentiality.

### Stage: Measurement of Intervention Outcomes
* **Scientific Reasoning:** Assessment process and gathering evidence for treatment efficiency based on criteria. Use of available and accessible assessment tools. Gathering evidence regarding intervention efficiency.
* **Narrative Reasoning:** Evaluation of the therapeutic process and its results according to the perception of the student, their family, and significant factors in the community.
* **Pragmatic Reasoning:** Measurement of results towards formative assessment and at the end.
* **Ethical Reasoning:** Transferring information to the team regarding intervention results while strictly maintaining ethical rules of the student's and family's privacy.
* **Interactive Reasoning:** Adhering to professional and clear phrasing for the student and their family. Sharing findings with them.

## Examples of Questions in the Professional (Clinical) Reasoning Process

### Scientific Reasoning
* What is the diagnosis?
* What is known about the diagnosis in the literature? What is the prognosis? What functional difficulties are expected?
* Which assessment and diagnostic tools are worth using?
* Which intervention approach has been proven effective in the literature?

### Narrative Reasoning
* How is the difficulty/illness/functional limitation perceived by the student, their family, and factors in the community?
* How is the difficulty perceived by the school staff and peer group?
* What are the attitudes of the student and their family toward change?
* The therapeutic history according to the family's and child's perception: what succeeded and what did not?

### Pragmatic Reasoning
* What is the extent of the treatment's compatibility with existing procedures in the educational institution?
* What are the time resources available to the occupational therapist?
* What equipment is necessary to perform the process and is it available?
* Is there sufficient space to implement the intervention?
* Is the space suitable for implementing the intervention in a safe/intimate manner? Is benefit to the patient/avoidance of harm guaranteed?
* Are the partners required for intervention efficiency available? (Assistant, teacher, kindergarten teacher, parents, another therapeutic staff member).
* How to build a personal schedule adapted and efficient for learning and treatment needs simultaneously?
* In what manner is guidance provided to the occupational therapist in the educational institution?

### Ethical Reasoning
* Is maintenance of medical confidentiality and privacy rules taking place?
* Does the intervention align with maintaining values of human dignity, equality, and prevention of discrimination?
* Has the occupational therapist been sufficiently trained to perform the intervention?

### Interactive Reasoning
* Who are my partners for the intervention?
* What information should be transferred to the multi-disciplinary team? What are the subjects I must consult on?
* By what means and ways should information on the intervention course and its results be transferred?

## Approaches in Occupational Therapy (OTPF)
Intervention approaches are the specific strategies that direct the intervention process for the purpose of achieving its goals, and include: Health promotion, Remediation/Restoration, Maintain, Adaptation, and Prevention. These intervention approaches dictate the choice of applied models, frames of reference, or theories guiding treatment.

1.  **Health Promotion:** A therapeutic concept assuming an absence of limitation/injury in performance ability. Based on creating experiences and enrichment activities aimed at encouraging adaptation and performance in natural contexts of daily life.
    * *Examples:* Developing a course on child development for parents of a first child; Building an ergonomic work environment to increase work efficiency and employee satisfaction.
2.  **Remediation, Restoration:** A therapeutic concept intended to change person factors with the goal of building a skill or ability that has not yet developed, or restoring a skill or ability that has been damaged.
    * *Examples:* Building morning routines necessary to arrive at school or work on time; Restoring mobility ability necessary for play activities; Improving self-advocacy skills to cope with workplace demands.
3.  **Maintain:** A therapeutic concept aimed at enabling a person to preserve their performance capabilities. The assumption is that without continuous maintenance intervention and the creation of support systems, performance and occupational needs will not be met, thereby affecting the person's health and quality of life.
    * *Examples:* Maintaining the ability to meet a schedule for taking medication on time by providing a timer; Maintaining safe and independent accessibility for people with low vision via increased lighting; Maintaining independent gardening ability for people with wrist limitations by adapting handles for gardening tools; Maintaining ranges and strength in upper limb necessary for independent mobility in a wheelchair by performing exercises.
4.  **Modify, Adaptation, Compensation:** A therapeutic concept directed at finding ways to change the current context or activity demands in order to support performance in the natural environment. Includes compensatory techniques, emphasizing certain features as cues, or reducing features to prevent distraction.
    * *Examples:* Organizing a sequence of morning routine tasks for a person with cognitive impairment; Housing adaptation; Accessibility adaptations for a computer (virtual keyboard, reversed mouse); Adaptations for matriculation exams.
5.  **Disability Prevention:** A therapeutic concept directed at providing a response to people with or without a limitation, who are at risk for problems in occupational performance/function, with the goal of preventing the development of factors that inhibit occupational performance/function.
    * *Examples:* Preventing poor posture during prolonged sitting by providing a chair with appropriate back support; Preventing social isolation by recommending participation in an activity group after work; Preventing a rise in blood pressure during household activities by learning to monitor blood pressure in a cardiac exercise program; Screening programs in family health stations and kindergartens.
